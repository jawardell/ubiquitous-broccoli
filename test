\subsection*{Introduction}
\tab 
Lattice paths have been studied extensively over the course of several centuries. For the purpose of this study, a lattice consists of points $\set{Z}^{2}$ with certain restrictions and with only two allowable moves, up-right and
down-right.
Movements in various directions on the lattice are called paths.
\\*
\tab A corridor is a rectangular region within a lattice The lattice path enumeration model that we propose consists of a starting point, an upper and lower bound, and all possible paths from said starting point to some end point.
The area in which the paths are propagated is referred to as a corridor. The number of paths within the corridor depend on the initial values of the starting point, the nature of the upper and lower bounds, and the value placed at the
starting point. In our model, the lower bound is a line with zero slope and the upper bound is a line with a variable slope. These conditions seem to present a problem when attempting to systematically generate the values contained 
in the corridors. Due to the nature of the upper bound, which is a line with slope not parallel to that of the lower bound, the paths bounce off of the upper diagonal line, 
rippling into and distorting the data below it. One would think that calculating the error caused by each interruption would be somewhat intuituve, but the impacts of each diagonal-boundary disturbance grow larger and more disturbing as
time in the corridor progresses. Although the data changes because of the upper bound's slope, intruiguing patterns and characteristics have been observed in the configurations of this environment. 
We call the model
which has been breifly introduced a skewed top corridor. \\*
\tab The corridor exists on a two dimensional plane which involves the elapse of time on the horizonal axis and the amount of paths on the vertical axis. A gap extends vertically from the starting point and contains the 
initial value which is placed at the starting point. The gap contains elements, other than the value initialized at the start point, of zero value. A diagonal line, which the paths can touch but 
not surpass, begins just above the gap and extends to a finite point on the grid. Paths can move in an upward or downward direction in the corridor.






%at each point. When these lattice paths are confined to an area in which they must exist, it is called a corridor and the place in
%the corridor where non zero values appear is called the fundamental area *hmm*. The corridors which restrict lattice paths consist
%of two *?* boundaries which are lines. The boundary lines can have the same slope, or the slope of either line can be different. The 
%slope properties of the two boundary lines depends on the context of the situation being modeled and other constrains and conditions
%that exist in the system. Two common examples of lattice path enumeration within some bounded corridor consist of boundaries that 
%have the same slope and are parallel, or two lines in which the bottom has some different slope while the top has a slope of one. The 
%situation which is modeled in this paper consists of a corridor with a bottom boundary line with slope of one while the top line
%has some slope which is not equal to one. This seems to cause problems with being able to calculate numbers in the corridor as opposed to
%the other models. In the two previosly mentioned situations, the corridor with a bottom boundary with different slope, is more predictable
%because there are tricks one can play to manipulate the values which will appear later. The model which studies the corridor contained
%by two parallel lines with the same slope is also maliable due to the fact that the two lines have the same slope and the values
%inside the fundmental region are not disturbed by any line. When one models a system in which the paths are contained by an upper 
%boundary line with a slope not parallel to the lower line, however, additional factors must be taken into account in order to analyse
%the values within the region.\\*
%\tab In this system, paths are represented on a grid which is in a two-dimensional space. Paths can exist in 
%more than two dimensional spaces, but for the purpose of this study, they are in a two dimensional Euclidian space. *for now?*
%In this space, the vertical axis models the 
%amount of steps taken at some point in the space. The horizontal axis in this grid plane represents the amount of time that has elapsed in taking 
%one step in the space *what units of time, and does the length of each 'step' matter? do we care about length of steps or are we just
%counting?*. *Should I start explaining things in detail -- the array of 0's, the gap, the slope. the position -- or wait until
%sybmols and Def's?* if so: *talk about how the paths can move, up/down, can paths sit on the line or not and why*
%\\* *talk about all zeros and natural numbers and WHY*
%\\* *talk about why someone can't take zero steps to start*
%\\* *talk about the gap and why we would do that*
%\\* *talk about the slope and why we would do that*
%\\* *talk about the position and why we would chnage that*
%\\* *would we start with a different value other than one at the start position?, address that as well*
%\\* *answer those questions, but leave room for some insight/ thoughful comments at conclusion*

\subsection*{Symbols and Definitions}

The paths in this model exist in a space composed of natural numbers including zero. The natural numbers not including zero may 
also be referenced.
Let $\set{N}$ represent the set natural numbers not including zero and $\set{N}_0$ represent the set natural numbers including zero.\\*\\*
Let $\set{Z}$ represent the set of integers which may also be used in describing the system of paths.\\*\\*
The upper boundary restricting the corridor from above has a slope. The slope has a rise of $1$ over some variable
in the set of natural numbers not including zero, $r \in \set{N}$.
Let $m$ represent slope, $m=\frac{1}{r}$ which, for now, is a fixed number, $m=\frac{1}{2}$.\\*\\*
A gap of alloted space is initialized upon creation of the corridor area. This is a column with a height of some value in 
the set of natural numbers. This gap should be greater than or equal to one.
Let $g \in \set{N}$. This represents a gap above the initial point and contains $g$ elements.\\*\\*
Let $a \in \set{N}$ be the location on the horizontal axis where the paths begin. The starting point will always be a position $a$ on the horizontal and at position $0$ on the vertical. This value needs to reside within the gap, so $a \geq g$.\\*\\*
The paths that are propagated from the start point to some other point begin with some initial number of paths taken. Let $v \in \set{N}$ dictate how many paths exist at the start point.\\*\\*
The model considers the elapse of time at each point in the lattice corridor. For some moment in time, a specific number of paths exits at some point in the grid space. Let $n \in \set{N}_0$ model the time period in which the paths can be modeled where the corridor
 only extends for $n$ inclusive columns.\\*\\*
The corridor containing all possible path combinations is a subset on an infinite plane of integers. 
Consider a  function, $V \mathpunct{:} \set{N}_0 \times \set{N}_0 \rightarrow \set{N}_0$ called a corridor state function. Then $V(x, n)$ represents the number of paths at any point $(x, n)$ in the corridor, where $x \in \set{N}_0$.
While the corridor consists of only natural numbers including zero, the two dimensional grid space contains all $\set{Z}$ values. In other words, the range of $V$ is $\set{Z}$\\*\\*
The skewed top corridors may be referenced in relation to their $g$ value. Let $C_g$ be the corridor with $g = i$, $m = \frac{1}{2}$, $a = 1$, and $v = 1$.\\*\\*
The diagonals, a concepts discussed later, may also be referenced in the corridor. Let $C_id_j$ where $j \in \set{N}_0$. Then $C_id_j$ is the diagonal $j$ in corridor $i$.
\subsection*{Propagating Values}
\tab Choose some value for $a$ and some value for $v$. For now, $v = 1$ and $a = 1$. Insert $v$ into position $(0,a)$ in the
array.
Note that the starting point of all paths is $(0,a)$ and the value at said point is $v$. The
position on the vertical axis of the grid in this case is $a$.\\*
\tab Choose some value for $g$, which represents the size of a gap in column $1$ of the array. This gap consists of $g$ elements
and begins at point $(0,1)$ in the array. The gap extends upward to $(g+1, 0)$ and a sentinel boundary is placed at $(g+1, 0)$.
Continue establishing sentinel areas from $(g+1, 0)$, progressing through each column. Since $m=\frac{1}{2}$, move up one row in the array when an even column
is encountered. This is conintued until one reaches the $n^{th}$ column. A sentinel line is
 established with a slope of $\frac{1}{2}$. For now, assume that every value in the array on or above the sentinel line 
is equal to zero and assume that every value below row one in the array is equal to zero. The following recursive formula can be used to
calulate each value in the array, where $V(0, k) = $ initial state:
\\*
\[V(x,k) = V(x-1, k-1) + V(x+1,k-1) \] where , $x \in \set{N}$ and $k \in \set{N}$.

Notice that this forms an area of zero and nonzero values which reside above row one and below the sentinel line.
The area in which numbers are propagated, having chosen some value for $n$, consists of $n$ columns and $g+ \frac{n+1}{2}$ rows.
The values
that exist in this area are all natural numbers including zero. With this configuration complete,
\begin{itemize}
 \item with $a = 1$ and $v = 1$,
 \item having chosen some $n$,
 \item having chosen some $g$,
 \item and with $m=\frac{1}{2}$,
\end{itemize}
various observations can be made.

\subsection*{Observations}
\tab The corridor will contain values beginning at $(0, a = 1)$, with rows starting from $1$ extending to $g+ \frac{n+1}{2}$ and columns starting from $0$ extending to $n$.
\\*\\*
\tab From point $(0, a)$, a line of $1$s with slope one is generated until the sentenel line is hit at $(2g, 2g+1)$.
Beyond this point, diagonals containing four of the same elements repeat until the end of the corridor is reached. 
Upon reaching the sentinel line, a new diagonal begins just below the diagonal line of ones. The point at which the first diagonal of four elements begins is $(2g+1, 2g)$. % when $g$ is even and 
The first repeating diagonals will contain 4 elements and if $g$ is odd, these values will be $2g + 1$. 
If $g$ is even, numbers in the first four-diagonal are $2g - 1$.\\*\\*

If $n$ $\textgreater$ $2g$, the one diagonal will never hit the sentinel line before row $n$ is reached.\\*\\*


There are diagonals consisting of only zeros between each diagonal of nonzeros, where a diagonal (for these purposes) begins 
at some point, ($b \in V$, $c \in V$), consists of points $(b+1, c+1)$ ... , and extends to 
some distant point below or on the sentinel line. From any point on
the grid, moving in a horizontal line to the $n^{th}$ column, the values on the grid will alternate between zeros and nonzeros.\\*\\*

The diagonal beginning at point $(2, 0)$ and ending at $(2g, 2g-1)$ consists of counting numbers from $1$ to $2g$. This diagonal gets
 disturbed by the senintel line and gets added up with the final $1$ from the first diagonal line of ones. The resulting value
 is the first value of the $4$ element repeating diagonals.\\*\\*

The diagonal beginning at point $(0,4)$ and ending at $(2g-1, 2g-5)$ contains numbers that are on the outer edge of a triangluar
arrangement of $\set{Z}$.\\*\\*

In a horizontal traversal with slope $0$ from point $(1, 0)$ to point $(1, 2g-1)$, one can observe the Catalan numbers $C_0$ to $C_g$,
 however, this pattern quickly gets destroyed at row $2g-1$ when the first diagonal of ones hits the sentinel line. This causes
 what should be $g+1^{th}$ Catalan number to be off by negetive one or positive one, thus this pattern disappears.\\*\\*
 
 The various values that exist in the $4$ element repeating diagonals do not seem to have any known relationship.\\*\\*
 %need to add up the cols to see if there is a relationship there
 
 
% With the slope preset to $m = \frac{1}{2}$, the diagonals seem to have a period of $\frac{2}{m}$, two times the run. Let's begin
 %to think about the progression within the period of each repeating diagonal. Recall that the values contained in the diagonal 
 %below the line of ones count up to some number, $2g + 1$, and begin repeating at that number. This is because the line of ones 
 %'bounces off' the sentinel line for the first time at .
 %The position in which the presumed order becomes disturbed seems to always be at $g*row_number from one to number of rows$ *make sum*. 
% From this 
 %So, it seems that the period of diagonal consists of four elements, two times
 %the run, and exists from columns $[2g + 1, 4g - 1]$ *not sure how to express*.
 %The period beings when the fourth element in the repeating diagonal expires passing on its value onto the next diagonal. 
% Is there some way to calculate this next value in the diagonal which will repeat four times and pass on its value to the next?
 %It seems that the diagonal is composed of the error amount in each column and the diagonal value. Before the first diagonal 
 %of four begins, the $\set{N} \times \set{N}$ corridor. Compare these values with the numbers in the period of the disturbed diagonals
 %and one can see that the errors begin at one, but grow quickly. These errors are allowed four changes due to the nature 
 %of the slope, $m = \frac{1}{2}$ which implies that the period is four. The progression of errors seems to begin at one, then $4$
 %is added every time until the period ends with the diagonal hitting the sentinel line. When this happens, the value of the 
 %diagonal is incorporated into the error calculation, resulting in the next repeating diagonal. For example, \\*
 
 
 \subsection*{Conjecture}
 Generating corridors starting at $C_1$ to some finite number, note the relationships between the $C_id_j^{th}$ diagonals across configurations. It appears that $d_j^{th}$ diagonals among corridors 
 make arithmetic sequences to the $j^{th}$ degree. \\*\\*
 The formula for the $d_0$ diagonal with $x_0 = 1$ is the following: \[f(x) = 1\]\\*
 The formula for the $d_1$ diagonal with $x_0 = 1$ is the following: \[f(x) = 2(x - 1) + 1\]\\*
The formula for the $d_2$ diagonal with $x_0 = 1$ is the following: \[f(x) = 2x^2+9x+3\]\\*
The formula for the $d_3$ diagonal with $x_0 = 1$ is the following:  \[f(x) = \frac{4}{3}x^3+16x^2+\frac{149}{3}x+13\]\\*
The formula for the $d_4$ diagonal with $x_0 = 1$ is the following:  \[f(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^4+\frac{46}{3}x^3+\frac{707}{6}x^2+\frac{1867}{6}x+68\]\\*


As the values for $g$ increment for a new configuration of $C_g$, it seems that the 
arithmetic sequences continue to follow the pattern of being sequences of the $j^{th}$ degree.\\*\\*
These values are considered by first indexing "default" corridors $C_1$ to $C_g$, where $i$ is the corridor with $g = i$.
Then index the diagonals in the corridors from $0$ to $j$, where $j$ is the $j^{th}$ diagonal in the corridor. With this indexing complete, 
notice that we are comparing diagonals of the same index among subsequent corridors. These lists of diagonal numbers among corridors as $g$ increases 
is what seems to produce the arithmetic sequences. This prensents the question of how to prove that this really occurs, rather, how to navigate among 
diagonals within a single corridor. Although this pattern of arithmetic sequences to the $j^{th}$ degree has occured among diagonals of the same index
among subsequent corridors, how can one be certain that this most definately occurs as $g$ increases? We begin answering this question by observing the 
relationship among diagonals in one corridor; moreover, how can one traverse diagonals within one corridor? What is the pattern to calculate the next diagonal 
value in the same corridor and how can we be certain that this pattern holds? These are the questions that will lead to proving that the corridor diagonals are
certainly arithmeitc sequences of the $j^{th}$ degree.



 %Take a look at each new configuration from $g$ starting at one to any finite, positive integer. Begin numbering the diagonals of a corridor, starting at zero, for each configuration of $g$. The number of repeating diagonals present depends on 
 %the value chosen for $n$. If one compares the diagonals between subsequent $g corridors$ with $g$ starting at $1$ to some other natural number, geometric series of degree $diagonal number$ seem to form. 
 

% Even with the position of the starting value being fixed, the results are different with each unique value of $g$. One can 
 %observe the interesting patterns that occur with each new configuration. What types of patterns, if any, exist when the 
% starting position is a point other than $(0,1)$? How can the ripple effects from differing values of $a$ be observed an analyzed?
