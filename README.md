# Skewed Top Corridor Number Generator

Skewed top corridor numbers lie within a 
structure called a skewed-top corridor. 
There is currently not a closed-form formula for 
skewed top corridor numbers. 

I wrote a program to generate STC numbers 
in a basic command line interface style. 

### How to use
First, clone this repository by issuing the following command: 

`git clone https://github.com/jawardell/ubiquitous-broccoli`


Then move into the directory: 

`cd ubiquitous-broccoli`

To generate STCs on a Unix terminal, 
execute the config script by issuing the 
following command: 

`./config`

To generate STCs on a Batch-Style terminal, 
issue the following commands: 

`javac src/slopeTester.java`
`java src/slopeTester`


Check out the programs that I wrote to generate 
the numbers. One can adjust the parameters to 
modify the numbers inside the corridors. 
Change the parameters and find new patterns within 
the corridors!
