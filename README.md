Skewed Top Corridor Number Generator

Skewed top corridor numbers lie within a 
structure called a skewed-top corridor. 
There is currently not a closed-form formula for 
skewed top corridor numbers. 

I wrote a program to generate STC numbers 
in a basic command line interface style. 

To generate STCs on a Unix terminal, 
execute the config script by issuing the 
following command: 

./config

To generate STCs on a Batch-Style terminal, 
issue the following commands: 

javac src/slopeTester.java
java src/slopeTester


Check out the programs that I wrote to generate 
the numbers. One can adjust the parameters to 
modify the numbers inside the corridors. 
Change the parameters and find new patterns within 
the corridors!
